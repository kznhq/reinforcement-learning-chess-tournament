# chess-reinforcement-learning-tournament
CSCI4511W Final Project

## The Plan
Using PettingZoo chess for the environment and Stable Baselines3 for the Masked PPO model.

Planning to tweak hyperparameters of Masked PPO to find optimal RL algorithm for chess as they compete in a tournament.

Might use TensorBoard for metrics/results
